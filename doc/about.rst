About Openlava Web Interface
============================

Openlava Web is a REST based web interface to the `Openlava scheduling system <http://www.openlava.org>`_. Openlava Web provides both HTML and JSON interfaces allowing users to view information on jobs, queues, hosts, and other components of the scheduling environment.

Openlava Web is written in Python and uses Django as the web framework and is licensed under the GNU Public License.

Users can perform actions such as killing, suspending and submitting new jobs to the cluster. Administrators can perform administrative tasks such as closing and opening hosts or queues. All actions can be done both via the web interface or programatically.

Openlava Web was written by `David Irvine <http://ay60dxg.com>`_ and is licensed under the GNU Public License.
