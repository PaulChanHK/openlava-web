Release Notes
=============

Version 1.1
-----------

All JS calls now use a Javascript library, this can also be used to extend the UI easily and uses the same
structure as the remote client, and local API.

All API calls are now standardized, predominantly the same calls (With some language specific differences) are
used regardless of the location, so that extending the UI, or creating remote clients requires learning only one
API.

Lists such as Job, Queue, and Host lists are now dynamically updated in the UI, and colour coded based on their
status.

All JSON responses now use a common format.

Improved documentation for classes and RESTful interface.

Command line tools have have improved error handling.
